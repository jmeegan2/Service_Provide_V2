Objective: Develop an interactive self-service customer portal that enhances the customer experience, streamlines support processes, and provides easy access to account management features for Comcast subscribers.

Features:

* User Authentication and Account Management:

* Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure privacy and data protection.
  Enable users to create accounts, update personal information, and manage their subscription plans.
  Service and Equipment Management:

* Allow users to view and manage their subscribed services, such as cable TV packages, internet plans, and phone lines.
  Provide the ability to order new services, upgrade or downgrade existing services, and schedule service activations or cancellations.
  Enable users to manage their equipment, such as cable boxes or modems, by troubleshooting common issues, requesting replacements, or initiating device diagnostics.

* Billing and Payment:
  Develop a billing system that provides users with detailed invoices, billing history, and payment due dates.
  Enable users to make online payments securely using various payment methods, such as credit cards, bank transfers, or digital wallets.
  Implement automated payment reminders and notifications for billing updates or upcoming due dates.
  Troubleshooting and Support:

* Offer a knowledge base or FAQ section that addresses common customer inquiries, providing self-help resources and troubleshooting guides.
  Provide a support ticketing system that allows users to submit and track service-related issues, outages, or equipment malfunctions.
  Implement live chat or messaging functionality to offer real-time support and assist users with complex queries.
  Service Availability and Upgrades:

* Integrate with Comcast's backend systems to display service availability in specific areas, allowing users to check for coverage before ordering or upgrading services.
  Offer personalized service recommendations based on users' usage patterns and preferences, promoting relevant upgrades or bundles.
  Notifications and Alerts:

* Implement a notification system that keeps users informed about service updates, maintenance schedules, upcoming promotions, or special offers.
  Enable users to configure their notification preferences, such as email, SMS, or push notifications, for different types of updates.

To develop the customer portal application using Spring Boot, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up the project
1. Open IntelliJ and create a new project.
2. Select "Spring Initializr" and choose the necessary dependencies such as Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf (for template rendering), and any additional dependencies you may require.
3. Configure the project details (e.g., Group, Artifact, and Version).

Step 2: Create the database schema
1. Determine the required database schema for storing user accounts, subscription information, billing details, etc.
2. Create the necessary database tables and define the relationships between them. You can use tools like MySQL Workbench or an embedded database like H2 for development purposes.

Step 3: Set up User Authentication and Account Management
1. Create a User entity class with necessary attributes such as username, password, email, etc.
2. Implement a user registration form and controller to handle new user registrations and store them in the database.
3. Implement user login functionality using Spring Security. Configure authentication providers, security rules, and password encryption.
4. Create user account management features such as updating personal information, managing subscription plans, etc.

Step 4: Service and Equipment Management
1. Create entities for services and equipment, defining their attributes and relationships.
2. Implement controllers and views to allow users to view and manage their subscribed services and equipment.
3. Implement features such as ordering new services, upgrading/downgrading existing services, and scheduling service activations or cancellations.

Step 5: Billing and Payment
1. Design a billing system to generate detailed invoices, store billing history, and track payment due dates.
2. Implement controllers and views to display invoices and billing history to users.
3. Integrate with a payment gateway to enable users to make secure online payments.
4. Set up automated payment reminders and notifications for billing updates or upcoming due dates.

Step 6: Troubleshooting and Support
1. Create a knowledge base or FAQ section with relevant articles and guides.
2. Implement a support ticketing system to allow users to submit and track service-related issues.
3. Integrate live chat or messaging functionality for real-time support.

Step 7: Service Availability and Upgrades
1. Integrate with Comcast's backend systems or use mock data to display service availability in specific areas.
2. Implement logic to check for coverage before allowing users to order or upgrade services.
3. Provide personalized service recommendations based on usage patterns and preferences.

Step 8: Notifications and Alerts
1. Implement a notification system to keep users informed about service updates, maintenance schedules, promotions, or special offers.
2. Allow users to configure their notification preferences for different types of updates (email, SMS, push notifications).

These steps provide a general guideline for developing the customer portal application using Spring Boot. You can further refine and expand upon these steps based on your specific requirements.
